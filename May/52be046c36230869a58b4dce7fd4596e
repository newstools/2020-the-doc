As Acting Minister of Communications & Digital Technologies, I have signed and gazetted directions on the Risk-Adjusted Strategy for the ICT sector. The gazetted directions allow, among other, electronic communication services and network services, advertising agencies, film and television production companies to resume operations. Last month President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the COVID-19 Risk Adjusted Strategy that provides a framework for a responsive guide to the social, educational and economic activities which can be undertaken during the state of national disaster. These Directions apply in addition to the existing restrictions and rules that are in place across all sectors and alert levels including COVID-19 health protocols and sanitation requirements. The following sectors and sub-sectors are permitted to be operational under Alert Level 4: The gazette of these directions follows consultation with the sector and their plans on how they will mitigate the prevention of the spread of the COVID-19. The directions further include a monitoring and compliance approach that will be followed by sector regulators, industry representative bodies and through the department’s COVID-19 Project Management Office. The Directions came into effect on 02 May 2020. I wish to thank the communications and digital technologies sector for their participation to date, and for the mitigation measures suggested, which will contribute to addressing and curbing the spread of COVID-19.
