3 March 2020 The Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies, Ms Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams will, on 4 March 2020, officially launch the Future-Innovation Lab, an innovative collaboration between Samsung South Africa and the University of Western Cape (UWC). Poised to digitally transform young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, the Future-Innovation Lab provides an opportunity for young people aged between18 and 35 to gain skills in software development and digital social innovation. The current intake of 40 students is being trained on web and mobile software development. This intervention forms part of Samsung’s R280 million Equity Equivalent Investment Programme (EEIP) which was unveiled in May 2019. Samsung’s EEIP projects mainly focus on skills development and are projected to have a measurable impact on job creation. In addition to the six-month development experience, Samsung and UWC partnered with Microsoft AppFactory to deliver an advanced nine-month software development programme which seeks to address the gap of high-demand software skills. Accordingly, the programme targets software developers who lack practical work experience. Members of the media are invited to the Future-Innovation Lab launch which will take place as follows: Date: Wednesday, 4 March 2020Time: 11h00 – 14h00Venue: UWC School of Public Health Building, Robert Sobukwe Road, Belville, Cape Town For Media RSVP/Enquiries please contact:Mish Molakeng Cell: 082 469 3997 Nthabeleng Mokitimi-Dlamini Cell: 073 222 5522
